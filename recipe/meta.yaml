  summary: 'Utility for managing old files in large directory structures'
  description: |
    Filebutler is a utility for managing old files in huge directory trees.
    Huge means of the order of 100 million files. The motivation is that
    find is far too slow on directory trees with this many files. Even
    working with filelists generated offline by find can be rather slow for
    interactive use. Filebutler improves on this by structuring filelists by
    age, by size, by owner, and by dataset.
